# Rust Implementation of ["Complete and Easy Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism"](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/bidir.pdf)

This implementation focuses on being clean and easy to read/understand. A significant part of this implementation comes from, and a huge credit goes to, [this Rust implementation of the paper](https://github.com/JDemler/BidirectionalTypechecking)
